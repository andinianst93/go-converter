# Password Generator

1. A password should be at least 12 characters long (ideally 16 characters or more); our password-related research has found that 45 percent of Americans use passwords of eight characters or less, which are not as secure as longer passwords.
2. A password should include a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and characters.
3. You must have a unique password for each online account.
4. A password shouldn’t include any of your personal information like your birthday or address, as identity theft and data breaches can compromise such information. It’s also best not to include any information that can be accessed on social media like kids’ or pets’ names.
5. A password shouldn’t contain any consecutive letters or numbers (i.e. ABCD, 1234, etc.)
6. A password shouldn’t be the word “password” or the same letter or number repeated.
